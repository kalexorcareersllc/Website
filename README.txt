-------------------------------------------

Files included:
- index.html       (Home)
- colleges.html    (For Colleges)
- graduates.html   (For Graduates)
- companies.html   (For Companies)
- contact.html     (Contact & mailto)
- styles.css       (Stylesheet)
- script.js        (Tiny JS for menu)
- README.txt       (this file)

How to use:
1) Unzip the package and open index.html in your browser to preview locally.
2) To publish for free:
   - Option 1 — GitHub Pages (recommended):
     * Create a new GitHub repository and push the files to the repository's `main` branch.
     * In repository Settings → Pages, choose the branch `main` and root folder `/` and save.
     * Your site will be available at https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/
   - Option 2 — Netlify (easy + supports forms):
     * Create a Netlify account, create a new site from "Deploy manual" or connect to GitHub.
     * Drag and drop the site folder or connect the GitHub repo.
     * Netlify will provide a free URL. To enable form handling, follow Netlify Forms docs.
   - Option 3 — Any static host (S3, Vercel, etc.)

Customizing:
- Edit text directly in the HTML files to update content.
- Replace the "people-blob" in index.html with your logo or header image (300x200 recommended).
- Contact email is set to: kalexorcareersllc@gmail.com
- If you'd like a functioning contact form that stores leads, deploy on Netlify and ask me to add a Netlify Forms version (I can provide the exact form markup).

Notes:
- This is a static site (no server-side code). Contact actions use mailto: by default.
- All colors and layout follow a warm/human design; modify styles.css to tweak brand colors.
- If you want me to add Netlify Forms, a hosted demo, or a logo file embedded, reply and I will update the package.

Thank you — site packaged on 2025-10-07
